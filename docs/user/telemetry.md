# Product usage data

T3 Code for Convene does not collect or send product usage analytics to T3 or PostHog.
Upstream analytics cannot be enabled through settings or environment variables.
The analytics service does not read provider account identifiers or create an anonymous identifier.

Local diagnostic logs and resource monitoring remain available for troubleshooting. This does
not change requests sent to the agents and model providers you configure, or to a Convene
platform you choose to connect to.

The web app in a browser, including one the `t3` CLI opens, does not read these environment
variables. When its build has relay tracing configured, it sends its own connection traces even
if the server has opted out. The browser app has no relay tracing toggle.

## Mobile app diagnostics

When the iOS or Android app crashes or hits an error, it sends a report to T3 Code: the error
message, the stack trace, the app version, and the device model and OS version. Each launch also
sends startup timings, and every report carries a random ID for the install. Reports go through
the T3 Connect relay to Axiom. They do not include your threads, prompts, or connection details,
but an error message can quote a value the app was handling.

To stop sending them, turn off **Send crash reports** in **Settings > About T3 Code > Diagnostics**.

The mobile app also sends relay connection traces when its build has tracing configured. These
carry an identifier for the current app session. **Send crash reports** does not control these
traces, and the mobile app has no separate relay tracing toggle. Server environment variables and
managed policy do not disable mobile tracing.

## Agent activity for mobile notifications

When **Publish agent activity** is enabled on a host, it sends project and thread titles, model
names, activity status, and environment and thread identifiers to the T3 Connect relay for
[mobile notifications and live activities](./mobile-notifications.md). This is separate from
product events and relay diagnostics. The telemetry opt-out does not disable it.

To stop publishing, turn off **Publish agent activity** under **Settings > Sharing & access** on
the host. Turning off notifications on a phone controls that phone's alerts, not the host's
publishing setting.

## Export diagnostics to your own receiver

To send traces, metrics, or logs to an OpenTelemetry receiver, open
**Settings > Maintenance > Diagnostics**, select an environment, and enter each signal's OTLP HTTP
endpoint under **OpenTelemetry export** (for example `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`). Save, then
restart that environment's server. The receiver must be reachable from the server's machine.
**Test** sends an empty export from the server to check an endpoint before or after you save it;
saved endpoints are checked when the section opens. Checks send authentication headers only to
the signal's currently running endpoint and do not follow redirects. To check a new endpoint
that requires authentication, save it and restart the server first.

`T3CODE_OTLP_*_URL` and standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` environment variables override the saved
settings. An overridden signal shows **Set by environment** and names the variable that set it, and its
**Test** checks the running endpoint instead of the field. For endpoints saved here or set with `T3CODE_OTLP_*_URL`, set `T3CODE_OTLP_HEADERS` for
receivers that need authentication and `T3CODE_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` for receivers that do
not accept JSON. An endpoint set with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` takes its headers and protocol from
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` instead.
